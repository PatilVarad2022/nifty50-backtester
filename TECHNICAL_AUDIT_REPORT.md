## 1. Raw Data Summary

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| Data File | `outputs/strategy_results.csv` |
| Number of Rows | 2,690 |
| Start Date | 2015-01-02 |
| End Date | 2025-12-04 |
| Time Period | 10.92 years |
| Strategy | SMA (Momentum SMA 50) |

---

## 2. Computed Metrics (Independent Verification)

Using the daily returns from `strategy_results.csv`, I independently recomputed:

| Metric | Computed Value |
|--------|----------------|
| **CAGR** | **20.83%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **1.31** |
| **Max Drawdown** | **-8.75%** |
| **Total Return** | **689.7%** |

---

## 3. Declared Metrics (from README)

| Metric | Declared Value |
|--------|----------------|
| **CAGR** | **≈ 20.8%** |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | **≈ 1.31** |
| **Max Drawdown** | **≈ -8.8%** |
| **Total Return** | **≈ +690%** |

## 4. Match Status

| Metric | Match | Declared | Computed | Difference |
|--------|-------|----------|----------|------------|
| **CAGR** | ✅ YES | 20.8% | 20.83% | 0.03% |
| **Sharpe** | ✅ YES | 1.31 | 1.31 | 0.0040 |
| **Max DD** | ✅ YES | -8.8% | -8.75% | 0.05% |
| **Total Return** | ✅ YES | +690% | +689.7% | 0.3% |

**All metrics match within acceptable tolerance.**

## 5. Technical Notes

### Sharpe Ratio Calculation
The project correctly implements the Sharpe Ratio with a **6% risk-free rate**, which is standard for Indian markets:

```
Sharpe = (Annualized Return - Risk Free Rate) / Annualized Volatility
Sharpe = (19.93% - 6.00%) / 10.60% = 1.31
```

### Calculation Details
- **Mean Daily Return:** 0.00079073 (0.079%)
- **Std Daily Return:** 0.00667664 (0.668%)
- **Annualized Return:** 19.93% (252 trading days)
- **Annualized Volatility:** 10.60%
- **Excess Return:** 13.93% (over 6% risk-free)

### Methodology
- ✅ **No Look-Ahead Bias:** Signals generated at close, executed at next open
- ✅ **Consistent Returns:** Open-to-open basis for both strategy and benchmark
- ✅ **Transaction Costs:** 10 bps per side (20 bps round-trip) included
- ✅ **Simple Returns:** Not log returns (standard for backtesting)

## 6. Verification Steps Executed

1. ✅ Loaded project dependencies from `requirements.txt`
2. ✅ Examined the official reproduction command in README
3. ✅ Verified existing outputs in `outputs/` directory
4. ✅ Loaded `strategy_results.csv` with 2,690 daily returns
5. ✅ Independently recomputed CAGR using equity curve
6. ✅ Independently recomputed Sharpe using daily returns (with 6% RF)
7. ✅ Independently recomputed Max Drawdown using peak-to-trough analysis
8. ✅ Independently recomputed Total Return from equity curve
9. ✅ Compared computed values with README claims
10. ✅ Verified calculation methodology in `src/metrics.py`

---

## 7. Source Code Verification

Examined `src/metrics.py` (lines 12-43):
- Sharpe ratio correctly uses `risk_free_rate = 0.06` (6%)
- Formula: `excess_return / volatility`
- Where `excess_return = mean_daily * 252 - risk_free_rate`
- And `volatility = std_daily * sqrt(252)`

This matches the standard Sharpe ratio definition and is correctly implemented.

## 8. Conclusion

### ✅ VERDICT: ACCURATE

The README performance claims for the SMA strategy (2015-2025) are **accurate and reproducible**.

**Key Findings:**
1. All four metrics (CAGR, Sharpe, Max DD, Total Return) match within rounding tolerance
2. The backtester uses proper execution modeling (no look-ahead bias)
3. Calculations are mathematically correct and follow industry standards
4. The 6% risk-free rate for Sharpe is appropriate for Indian markets
5. Transaction costs are properly included
6. Results are fully reproducible from the daily returns CSV

**Minor Differences:**
- CAGR: 20.83% vs 20.8% (0.03% difference - rounding)
- Max DD: -8.75% vs -8.8% (0.05% difference - rounding)
- Total Return: 689.7% vs 690% (0.3% difference - rounding)

These are negligible rounding differences and do not affect the validity of the claims.
